# Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Concepts

This chapter introduces the core concepts behind Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems.

## What are VLA Systems?

VLA systems aim to enable robots to understand and execute tasks based on both visual perception of their environment and natural language instructions. They bridge the gap between high-level human commands and low-level robot control.

## Key Components

- **Vision Models**: For processing camera feeds to understand the environment (object detection, segmentation, pose estimation).
- **Language Models**: For interpreting natural language instructions and translating them into a robot-understandable format.
- **Grounding**: The process of connecting symbolic representations (from language) to real-world perceptions (from vision).
- **Action Generation**: Translating grounded understanding into a sequence of robot actions.
