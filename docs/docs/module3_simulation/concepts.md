# Simulation Concepts

This chapter introduces the core concepts of robotics simulation.

## Why Simulate?

Simulation is a powerful tool in robotics for several reasons:

- **Safety**: It is much safer to test new algorithms and behaviors in a simulated environment before deploying them on a physical robot.
- **Cost**: Simulators are free and can run on a personal computer, whereas physical robots can be expensive.
- **Speed**: Simulations can often run faster than real-time, allowing you to test your code more quickly.

## Simulators

This book will cover three popular simulators:

- **Gazebo**: A popular open-source simulator that is well-integrated with ROS.
- **Unity**: A powerful game engine that can be used for robotics simulation with the Unity Robotics Hub.
- **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**: A photorealistic, GPU-accelerated simulator for robotics.
