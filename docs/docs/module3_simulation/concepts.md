# Simulation Concepts

This chapter introduces the core ideas behind robotics simulation.

## Why Simulate?

Simulation is an essential tool in robotics for several reasons:

- **Safety**: Testing new algorithms or behaviors in a simulated environment avoids risks to real robots and humans.  
- **Cost**: Simulators run on standard computers, while physical robots can be expensive to build and maintain.  
- **Speed**: Simulations can run faster than real time, letting you test and iterate on code more quickly.

## Popular Simulators

This book focuses on three widely used simulators:

- **Gazebo**: Open-source, ROS-integrated, widely used in research and education.  
- **Unity**: A versatile game engine; robotics simulations leverage the Unity Robotics Hub.  
- **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**: Photorealistic, GPU-accelerated simulation platform for robotics research and development.
