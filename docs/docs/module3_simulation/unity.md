# Unity Simulation

Unity provides a visually rich and flexible platform for robotics simulation, enabling safe and efficient testing of humanoid robots.

## Key Features

- Realistic physics and high-quality graphics  
- Support for humanoid robot animations  
- ROS 2 integration via **ROS#** or **ROS-TCP Connector**  
- Suitable for AI and reinforcement learning experiments  

## Getting Started

1. Install **Unity Hub** and the **Unity Editor** (preferably the LTS version).  
2. Create a new project and import ROS 2 communication packages.  
3. Import your humanoid robot 3D model.  
4. Set up scenes, cameras, and physics materials.  
5. Launch the simulation and control the robot through ROS 2 nodes.

## Example Use Case

- Test robot navigation and obstacle avoidance in a virtual environment before deploying to real hardware.
