# Unity Simulation

Unity offers a visually rich and flexible environment for robotics simulation, allowing you to test humanoid robots safely and efficiently.

## Key Features

- Realistic physics and graphics
- Humanoid robot animation support
- ROS 2 integration via ROS# or ROS-TCP Connector
- Suitable for AI and reinforcement learning experiments

## Getting Started

1. Install **Unity Hub** and the **Unity Editor** (preferably LTS version).  
2. Create a new project and import ROS 2 communication packages.  
3. Import your humanoid robot 3D model.  
4. Set up scenes, cameras, and physics materials.  
5. Launch the simulation and interact with the robot via ROS 2 nodes.

## Example Use Case

- Simulate robot navigation and obstacle avoidance in a virtual environment before deploying to real hardware.
