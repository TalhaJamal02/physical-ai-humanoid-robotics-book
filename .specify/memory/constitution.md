# Technical Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Technical Accuracy
All claims must be backed by verified, real sources, such as official documentation or credible references. No hallucinated tools or APIs are permitted.

### II. Clear, Developer-Focused Writing
Writing must be clear, concise, and targeted at a developer audience. The tone should be instructional, avoiding filler content.

### III. Spec-Driven Structure
The project will follow the Spec-Kit Plus methodology, ensuring a structured and organized development process.

### IV. Practical, Runnable Examples
All code examples must be valid and runnable. If a code block is for illustrative purposes only, it must be clearly marked as such.

## Key Standards & Constraints
- **Docusaurus Structure**: Must follow Docusaurus conventions (sidebar, versioning, clean folders).
- **Formatting**: Use Markdown-compatible citations and formatting.
- **Platform Assumption**: Commands assume a Linux/macOS environment unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## Success Criteria
- **Build & Deployment**: The Docusaurus site must build without errors and deploy cleanly to GitHub Pages.
- **Content Integrity**: All information must be correct and consistent.
- **Overall Quality**: The book must feel cohesive, professional, and technically solid.

## Governance
Amendments to this constitution require documentation and approval. All contributions must align with these principles.

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-12-05 | **Last Amended**: 2025-12-05
